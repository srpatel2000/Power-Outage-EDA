# Power-Outage-EDA


# Summary of Findings
Introduction
The 'outage.xlsx' dataset represents inputs about major outages in different states of the United States from 2000 to 2016. The topics of the columns are: general information, regional climate information, outage events information, regional electricity consumption information, regional economic characteristics, and regional land-use characteristics. A more detailed description of the separate columns can be found at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182.

In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis in order to perform some sort of hypothesis test. In order to develop a hypothesis, we narrowed down what we were exploring to a few possible questions and inquiries. These include:

- Where and when do major power outages tend to occur?
- What characteristics are associated with each category of cause?
- How have characteristics of major power outages changed over time? Is there a clear trend?

Below we will be providing a summary of what we accomplished in the different sections of this notebook.
